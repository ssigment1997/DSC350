print('Welcome to my first program')
feet_of_optic = int(input('Enter the number of feet of fiber optic to be installed:'))



charge_1 = float(.80)
charge_2 = float(.70)
charge_3 = float(.50)

if feet_of_optic >= 100:
    total_cost = feet_of_optic * charge_1
    print(f'the total cost is {total_cost}')

elif feet_of_optic >= 250:
    total_cost = feet_of_optic * charge_2
    print(f'the total cost is {total_cost}')

elif feet_of_optic >= 500:
    total_cost = feet_of_optic * charge_3
    print(f'the total cost is {total_cost}')

else:
