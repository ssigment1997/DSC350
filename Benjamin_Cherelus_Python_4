# Write a program that uses a function to convert miles to kilometers. Your program should prompt the user for the number of miles driven, then call a function that converts miles to kilometers. The program should then display the total miles and kilometers:

def main():
    final()

def final():
    number_of_miles_driven = int(input('Enter the number of miles driven:'))
    total_kilometers = number_of_miles_driven * 1.60934

    print(f'You have a drove a total of {number_of_miles_driven} miles and {total_kilometers} kilometers')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
