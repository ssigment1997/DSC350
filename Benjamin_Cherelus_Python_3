Assignment:

Write a program that uses a while loop to determine how long it takes for an investment to double at a given interest rate. The input will be an annualized interest rate and the initial investment amount. The output is the number of years it takes an investment to double.

#Code starts here
annualized_interest_rate = float(input('Enter the annual interst rate:'))

initial_investment = float(input('Enter the your initial investment:'))

doubled_investment = initial_investment * 2  # fix: use *2, not **2
current_value = initial_investment
years = 0

while current_value < doubled_investment:  # fix: should be <
    current_value = current_value * (1 + annualized_interest_rate)  # fix: compound growth
    years += 1

print(f'It will take {years} years for your investment to double')  # moved out of loop
